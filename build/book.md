Satellite Field Guide
=====================
Version: 2013-12-17

Ucontent/executiveU summary
===========================

The "Satellite Field Guide" publication seeks to educate NGOs, activists, media organisations and technologists who use or are considering the use of satellite technologies for their operations.

It gives access to technical knowledge in an easy to understand manner, making ample use of infographics and draws on a range of existing technological expertise and research literature. It also makes available an initial series of testing protocols in addition to their results in order to promote a better understanding of satellite technologies from a security and privacy angle and support the emergence of evidence-driven awareness raising about existing issues.

### Summary

This field guide was created as a resource for Human Rights defenders, Journalists and Activists,NGOs and donor organizations working with satellite technology in the field or wishing to deploy such tools.

Ucontent/satelliteU security
============================

### Vulnerabilities

### Surveillance

### Jamming
Jamming is the practise of willingfully blocking or distorting the signal by introducing noise (another meaningless signal). Satellite Jamming is internationally condemned and forbidden, but still happens in a lot of areas. Examples are Iran ...

Jamming is the mixing of the meaningful signal of the sender with another strong signal that is meaningless, so the receiver can not make anything of the original signal. It is like someone shouting through your conversation in the real world.

This can happen at two points in the process, First it can happen at the satellite, this is called *orbital jamming*. Secondly it can happen at the receiver side, then it will be called *Terrestrial(on earth) jamming*.


#### Orbital jamming
This acts by having a rogue groundstation that points a high power beam at teh
