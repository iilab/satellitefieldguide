# Satellite Field Guide

## Overview

The "Satellite Field Guide" publication seeks to educate NGOs, activists, media organisations and technologists who use or are considering the use of satellite technologies for their operations. 

It gives access to technical knowledge in an easy to understand manner, making ample use of infographics and draws on a range of existing technological expertise and research literature. It also makes available an initial series of testing protocols in addition to their results in order to promote a better understanding of satellite technologies from a security and privacy angle and support the emergence of evidence-driven awareness raising about existing issues.
